/**
 * Hi and welcome to team Gilded Rose.
 *
 * As you know, we are a small inn with a prime location in a prominent city
 * ran by a friendly innkeeper named Allison. We also buy and sell only the
 * finest goods. Unfortunately, our goods are constantly degrading in quality
 * as they approach their sell by date. We have a system in place that updates
 * our inventory for us. It was developed by a no-nonsense type named Leeroy,
 * who has moved on to new adventures. Your task is to add the new feature to
 * our system so that we can begin selling a new category of items. First an
 * introduction to our system:
 *
 * - All items have a SellIn value which denotes the number of days we have to sell the item
 * - All items have a Quality value which denotes how valuable the item is
 * - At the end of each day our system lowers both values for every item
 *
 * Pretty simple, right? Well this is where it gets interesting:
 *
 * - Once the sell by date has passed, Quality degrades twice as fast
 * - The Quality of an item is never negative
 * - "Aged Brie" actually increases in Quality the older it gets
 * - The Quality of an item is never more than 50
 * - "Sulfuras", being a legendary item, never has to be sold or decreases in Quality
 * - "Backstage passes", like aged brie, increases in Quality as it's SellIn
 *   value approaches; Quality increases by 2 when there are 10 days or less and
 *   by 3 when there are 5 days or less but Quality drops to 0 after the concert
 *
 * We have recently signed a supplier of conjured items. This requires an
 * update to our system:
 *
 * - "Conjured" items degrade in Quality twice as fast as normal items
 *
 * Just for clarification, an item can never have its Quality increase above
 * 50, however "Sulfuras" is a legendary item and as such its Quality is 80 and
 * it never alters.
